		<h1>I Stole This</h1>
		<p> The code that makes this look slightly nice is
		from <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">
		A Better Motherfucking Website</a>. I had seen the site
		in a Reddit thread in the last couple of years and
		liked the simple look. So I looted the site and updated
		it with my own content in a clean install of Neovim
		(I hadn't used it in a while).</p>
		<p>Things I want to do next:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Get some Neovim config going to make writing
			the HTML and CSS for this bareable.</li>
			<li>Learn more about web dev in general with the
			eventual goal of making a nice, customized, digital
			garden.</li>
			<li><em>Maybe</em> try to make a markdown to HTML converter
			for funzies before picking a tool that can do it
			better.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I know this is super minimal, but just seeing a nice clean
		webpage with some of my words on it is neat.</p>
